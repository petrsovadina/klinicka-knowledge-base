# Market Analysis - Landscape Survey

## Context
- **Playbook:** Market Research
- **Agent:** {{AGENT_NAME}}
- **Auto Run Folder:** {{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}
- **Loop:** {{LOOP_NUMBER}}

## Objective

Survey the target market to understand its structure, identify relevant entity categories, and create templates for systematic research. This document establishes the research framework for subsequent discovery and research phases.

## Instructions

1. **Read the Agent-Prompt.md** to get the configured MARKET_TOPIC and OUTPUT_FOLDER
2. **Research the market broadly** using web search to understand:
   - Market size and growth trajectory
   - Key segments and subsegments
   - Major players and competitive dynamics
   - Recent news and developments
3. **Identify relevant entity categories** for this specific market
4. **Create entity templates** tailored to the market
5. **Output analysis** to `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_MARKET_ANALYSIS.md`
6. **Initialize the vault** with INDEX.md and folder structure

## Analysis Checklist

- [ ] **Analyze market and initialize vault (if needed)**: First check if `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_MARKET_ANALYSIS.md` already exists with at least one entity category defined in the "Entity Categories for Research" section. If it does, skip the analysis and mark this task complete—the market analysis is already in place. If it doesn't exist, read Agent-Prompt.md for MARKET_TOPIC and OUTPUT_FOLDER, use web search to understand the market landscape, identify which entity categories are most relevant, create the market analysis file with findings, and initialize the vault folder structure with INDEX.md as the launch page.

## Output Format

Create `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_MARKET_ANALYSIS.md`:
