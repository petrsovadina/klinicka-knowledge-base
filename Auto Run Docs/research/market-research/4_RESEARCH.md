# Entity Research - Build the Knowledge Vault

## Context
- **Playbook:** Market Research
- **Agent:** {{AGENT_NAME}}
- **Auto Run Folder:** {{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}
- **Loop:** {{LOOP_NUMBER}}

## Objective

Research ONE entity from the plan and create a comprehensive markdown profile in the knowledge vault. Use web search to gather current, accurate information and create meaningful links to related entities.

## Instructions

1. **Read the Agent-Prompt.md** to get the OUTPUT_FOLDER location
2. **Read the research plan** from `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_PLAN.md`
3. **Select ONE PENDING entity** (prioritize CRITICAL/HIGH importance)
4. **Research thoroughly** using web search
5. **Create the entity profile** in the vault using the appropriate template
6. **Add inter-page links** to related entities
7. **Update INDEX.md** with the new entity
8. **Update status** to RESEARCHED in the plan
9. **Log the research** to `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/RESEARCH_LOG_{{AGENT_NAME}}_{{DATE}}.md`

## Research Checklist

- [ ] **Research one entity (or skip if none)**: Read `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_PLAN.md`. If the file doesn't exist OR contains no PENDING entities with CRITICAL or HIGH importance, mark this task complete without changes. Otherwise, pick ONE PENDING entity with CRITICAL or HIGH importance. Use web search to gather comprehensive information. Create the entity profile in the vault following the template from the market analysis. Add `[[wiki-style]]` links to related entities. Update INDEX.md. Mark as RESEARCHED in the plan. Log to `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/RESEARCH_LOG_{{AGENT_NAME}}_{{DATE}}.md`.

## Research Process

### Step 1: Gather Information
Use web search to find:
- Official sources (company website, LinkedIn, press releases)
- Third-party coverage (news, analyst reports, reviews)
- Data sources (Crunchbase, financial filings, industry databases)
- Recent developments (last 6-12 months)

### Step 2: Synthesize Findings
- Cross-reference facts across multiple sources
- Note conflicting information
- Identify gaps in available information
- Extract key insights and trends

### Step 3: Write the Profile
- Follow the template from market analysis
- Write in clear, factual prose
- Include specific data points with sources
- Add context and analysis where valuable

### Step 4: Create Connections
- Link to related entities using `[[Entity Name]]` syntax
- Add the entity to related entities' "Related" sections if they exist
- Consider: competitors, partners, investors, founders, products

### Step 5: Update the Vault
- Save file in appropriate subfolder (Companies/, Products/, etc.)
- Update INDEX.md with link to new entity
- Ensure consistent naming: `Entity-Name.md` (kebab-case)

## Guidelines

- **One entity per run** - Depth over breadth
- **Verify facts** - Cross-reference important claims
- **Cite everything** - Include sources for all factual statements
- **Create links generously** - Connections add value
- **Update INDEX.md** - Keep the launch page current
- **Note gaps** - Document what you couldn't find
- **Stay current** - Prioritize recent information

## How to Know You're Done

This task is complete when ONE of the following is true:

**Option A - Researched an entity:**
1. You've researched exactly ONE entity from `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_PLAN.md`
2. You've created the entity profile in the vault
3. You've updated INDEX.md with a link to the new entity
4. You've appended the research details to `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/RESEARCH_LOG_{{AGENT_NAME}}_{{DATE}}.md`
5. You've updated the entity status in `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_PLAN.md` to `RESEARCHED`

**Option B - No PENDING entities available:**
1. `LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_PLAN.md` doesn't exist, OR
2. It contains no entities with status PENDING and importance CRITICAL or HIGH
3. Mark this task complete without making changes

This graceful handling allows the pipeline to continue when a loop iteration produces no entities requiring research.
