# Initialize Research Vault

## Context
- **Playbook:** Market Research
- **Agent:** Benjamin-wizzard
- **Auto Run Folder:** /Users/petrsovadina/Desktop/Develope/personal/klinicka-knowledge-base/Auto Run Docs
- **Loop:** 00001

## Purpose

This document initializes the research vault with the proper folder structure, creates entity-specific agents, and sets up Claude Code integration via `.claude/` with symlinks. **This runs once at the start before the main research loop begins.**

## Instructions

1. **Read the Agent-Prompt.md** to get the configured MARKET_TOPIC and OUTPUT_FOLDER
2. **Create the vault folder structure** with visible Agents/ and Commands/ folders
3. **Set up .claude/ with symlinks** so Claude Code can discover agents and commands
4. **Generate entity-type agents** customized for the market topic
5. **Create the research command** for easy invocation
6. **Initialize INDEX.md** as the vault launch page

## Initialization Checklist

- [x] **Initialize vault structure**: Read Agent-Prompt.md for MARKET_TOPIC and OUTPUT_FOLDER. Create the vault folder structure including Agents/, Commands/, .claude/ with symlinks, and entity subfolders. Generate entity-specific agents based on the market. Create initial INDEX.md and CLAUDE.md for the vault.
  - **Completed 2026-02-03**: Agent-Prompt.md was not found, so MARKET_TOPIC was inferred from project context as "Czech Healthcare AI & Decision Support". OUTPUT_FOLDER set to `vault/` within market-research folder. Created complete structure with 8 folders, 5 entity agents, 1 research command, INDEX.md, CLAUDE.md, and .claude/ symlinks.

## Vault Structure to Create

```
[OUTPUT_FOLDER]/
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents -> ../Agents      # Symlink to Agents folder
│   └── commands -> ../Commands  # Symlink to Commands folder
├── Agents/                      # Visible in Obsidian, holds agent definitions
│   ├── company-researcher.md
│   ├── product-researcher.md
│   ├── person-researcher.md
│   ├── technology-researcher.md
│   └── trend-researcher.md
├── Commands/                    # Visible in Obsidian, holds slash commands

```

## Create .claude/ with Symlinks

```bash
# Create .claude directory
mkdir -p [OUTPUT_FOLDER]/.claude

# Create symlinks (relative paths so they work if vault is moved)
cd [OUTPUT_FOLDER]/.claude
ln -s ../Agents agents
ln -s ../Commands commands
```

# Research Entity

Research a specific entity and add it to the [MARKET_TOPIC] knowledge vault.

## Usage
Provide the entity type and name to research.

## Process
1. Identify the appropriate agent for the entity type:
   - Company → use company-researcher agent
   - Product → use product-researcher agent
   - Person → use person-researcher agent
   - Technology → use technology-researcher agent
   - Trend → use trend-researcher agent

2. Spawn the agent with the Task tool to research the entity

3. Verify the profile was created and INDEX.md was updated

## Example
"Research the company Acme Corp"
→ Spawns company-researcher agent
→ Creates Companies/Acme-Corp.md
→ Updates INDEX.md
```

## Vault CLAUDE.md Template

Create in `[OUTPUT_FOLDER]/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
# [MARKET_TOPIC] Research Vault

## How to Know You're Done

This task is complete when:
1. All folders exist (Companies/, Products/, People/, Technologies/, Trends/, Resources/, Agents/, Commands/)
2. `.claude/` folder exists with working symlinks to Agents/ and Commands/
3. All five entity-type agents are created in Agents/
4. The research command is created in Commands/
5. INDEX.md exists with the market topic
6. CLAUDE.md exists with vault documentation

## Notes

- The symlinks allow Claude Code to discover agents/commands via `.claude/`
- Agents/ and Commands/ folders are visible in Obsidian for easy reference
- Entity agents are customized with the MARKET_TOPIC from configuration
- This only runs once - subsequent loops skip to 1_ANALYZE.md
